# 🚀 TinyGrad

> A tiny, elegant automatic differentiation engine built from scratch.

TinyGrad is a lightweight module for **automatic gradient computation**, the core mechanism behind training neural networks using **backpropagation**.

Inspired by:
- 🔬 [MicroGrad](https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd)
- 🔥 [PyTorch Autograd](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/autograd_tutorial.html)

...but extended to support more features than MicroGrad, without all the complexity of PyTorch. This module supports building **complete neural networks** and has a **clear educational purpose**.
